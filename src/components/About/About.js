                <p>We are actors working with actors and we react to things.
                    We hope to have an angular vue into the process of making a star.
                    Will we fizz out like the ember of a small flame or catch like a
                    giant meteor? Only a true artist with the backbone of a thespian
                    shall have this node to joy.
                </p>
            </>
